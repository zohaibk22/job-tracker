If the submission date seems to be in the email, make sure that the date extracted is related to the submission of the application (Looking for words like "submission" to be present), and nothing else. if you're not sure about the submission date, use the current date. Ensure that the date is also formatted as such: "full month name day, year" (e.g., "January 1, 2023").
